## How to Play

In this game, you can choose either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock. The computer also make a random selection. The rules for winning are as follows:

- Rock crushes Scissors

- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper

The winner is determined based on the rules above. If both you and your opponent make the same choice, it's a tie, and the game will be played again.
